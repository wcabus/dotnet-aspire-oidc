#.NET Aspire - OpenIdConnect sample

In short, this is a proof-of-concept to showcase how one could add an external OpenIdConnect service to a web project and configure said web project using a client ID/secret during development.
Perhaps this repo grows into a NuGet package at some point, but that's not the goal right now. 

Use this code at your own risk :)
